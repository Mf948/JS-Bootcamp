# My Html Journey Variable Integer 

The first part of coding is to create a variable. Let's get started with an integer variable.
What does an integer variable mean?

In most languages different "types" are defined.
What is a type?

A good example is that a letter is different than a number.

We will start with numbers.

Before starting to code, we need to visit another notion: script tag.
In html, Javascript code must be place inside script tag. You will see in the code below
<script>, it's the only place where code are interpreted.

Enough talking!

Complete the following code. Create a variable named: age with value 34.

age = xxxxxx;
Let's talk about our assignment:

Create an index.html file with this content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
    </body>
    <script>
      // Put your variable here
    </script>
</html>
To display your page you will need a static html page renderer (see annex at the bottom).
